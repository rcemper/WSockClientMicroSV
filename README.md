 This is a coding example working on IRIS 2020.2 
 It will not be kept in sync with new versions      
 It is also NOT serviced by InterSystems Support !

## Inspiration
Using the IRIS native API for Node.JS was the oportunity to present a MicroService operating in a Docker container.  
___My demo video is now also available to watch the demo in operation.__   
https://youtu.be/dSV-0RJ5Olg  

## What it does
This WebSocketClient Service runs in an own container checking for messages to be submitted using IRIS native API for Node.JS.  
The service operates with 3 Globals (Run/Stop WSserver, Input, Output)  
Data are fetched from IRIS and sent to an external WebSocket Echo Service and reply is written back to IRIS.  
All information is provided from IRIS.  
To visiualize operation the containr should run interactive.  
Control / Input / Output is all managed from a interactive utility in IRIS.     

## Challenges I ran into
- run a vanilla IRIS distribution out of the box __without docker-compose__
- transform interface from Cach√© into new IRIS native API. 

## Accomplishments that I proud of
- No need for ZPM or docker-compose.  
- A single docker container does it all.  
- Run the same image on native Docker (Linux) and Docker Desktop for Windows,
  (had no acces to MAC)  
- Build an All-in-1 image with Sevice and IRIS in a common container.

## What I learned
- Handling and running more than 1 Docker container in cooperation.  
- Working with Docker volumes.  
- Limits of Docker Desktop for Windows    

## Built with
- IRIS Community Edition in Docker  
- IRIS native API  
- Node.JS  
- Docker utility functions

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have native Docker or Docker Desktop installed.  
Pull and init the demo:  

- __docker pull store/intersystems/iris-community:2020.2.0.204.0__  
- __docker pull rcemper/rcc:demoJS__   
- __docker run --name ini1 --init -it --rm --privileged -v vol1:/external rcemper/rcc:demoJS bash /rcc/init.sh__

## How to Work With it
Run first a Docker exec session for the Control / In-Out utility in IRIS     
__docker run --name iris1 --init --rm -d -p 52773:52773 -p 51773:51773 -v vol1:/external store/intersystems/iris-community:2020.2.0.204.0 -b /external/pre.copy__  

Next start the Service process   
__docker run --name rcc1 --init -it --rm rcemper/rcc:demoJS /usr/bin/node /rcc/nodejs/WSockIris.js 172.17.0.2__ 

And start the control program for IRIS in a new command / terminal session   
__docker exec -it iris1 iris session iris ZSocket__
